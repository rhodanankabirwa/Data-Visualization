# Data-Visualization
This project mainly entails visualization of the Minnesota Breast cancer dataset using by using Tableau, to allow end-users to see and comprehend trends and patterns despite any prior/clear knowledge about. Tableau serves as an excellent software to create dashboards and statistical charts. 
The Minnesota Breast cancer data “Breast Cancer Dashboard Data and Messaging (Excel)” was used for visualization, having been obtained from https://www.health.state.mn.us/data/mcrs/data/dashbc.html. The data was the most preferred for this project because not only was it large and robust enough for the different visualizations, it was open to anyone online who is interested in using it. Following data acquisition and review, no data cleaning was undertaken since it was considered ready for analysis.
